You just need to npm install and npm build to get the bulid file and drag and drop on netlify on deploy mnually
After this the website is live and ready to go
We use emailjs for the email forms in react 
It is an api which let you send 200 emails free per day if you will need more you will need to pay something like 5-7$ a month
for this you need to ceate an google account or use one
after you finish this step you will be on dashboard 
first you need to locate in EmailForm.jsx and SendAMessageForm.jsx the sendEmail() function(first 30 line of code)
Now you will need to create a service. Go on emailjs =>Email services create a srvice which uses gmail
After that you will have a service-id which needs to be the first param in emailjs.send()
Ex: emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'template_mi1bri1', {email, message, phoneNumber, lastName, firstName}, "tKQab6k1GCmmOaiHx")
now you need to create a template here you can make it as you want, but the info from the web app 
is called by {{email}} or {{message}} and so on. Don't change the name from the code change it from the template
After you have your template done change like this :
emailjs.send('service_esf32jg', 'TEMPLATE_ID', {email, message, phoneNumber, lastName, firstName}, "tKQab6k1GCmmOaiHx")
Now the {email,message ...} will not be changed and the last "tKQab6k1GCmmOaiHx" is your emailjs public id
you get it from dashboard->account -> public key
Good luck if you have questions just ask
